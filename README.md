# Audio Visualizer Pro

This project is a real-time audio visualizer built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. You can upload an audio file, choose from various visualization styles, customize the appearance, and record the output as a video file. This version uses the Gemini API for AI-powered subtitle generation.

## Features

-   **Multiple Visualization Styles**: Choose from styles like 'Monstercat', 'Luminous Wave', 'Fusion', and more.
-   **AI Subtitle Generation**: Automatically generate time-synced subtitles in [00:00.00] format from your audio using the Gemini API.
-   **Real-time Customization**: Adjust sensitivity, balance, smoothing, text, fonts, and colors on the fly.
-   **Video Recording**: Record the canvas animation combined with the audio into a downloadable MP4/WebM file.

## Setup and Running

Follow these steps to set up the project on your own computer for development, deployment, or use as a Chrome extension.

### Prerequisites

-   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: LTS (Long-Term Support) version is recommended. `npm` is included.
-   **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Gemini API Key**: You need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/techtrekleo/audio-visualizer.git
    cd audio-visualizer-pro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command downloads all necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an Environment File:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project folder. Add your Gemini API key to this file. **The name must be `VITE_API_KEY`**.
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key. This file is ignored by Git and keeps your key private.

4.  **Run for Local Development:**
    This will start a local server. Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## How to Load as a Chrome Extension
